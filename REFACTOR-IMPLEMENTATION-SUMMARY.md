# Refactor System Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive multi-agent refactor workflow system as specified in `APM-REFACTOR-GUIDE.md`. The system orchestrates multiple Claude Code instances through a structured workflow for managing complex codebase changes.

## What Was Built

### 1. Core Infrastructure
- **Command System**: `/refactor` command integrated with Claude Code
- **Directory Structure**: Organized workflow scripts, commands, and session management
- **Bootstrap Integration**: Automatic installation via main bootstrap script

### 2. Workflow Implementation

#### Step 1: Questions Generation
- Opus instance analyzes refactor guide
- Generates comprehensive questions organized by phases
- Interactive editor integration for user answers
- Session persistence for context retention

#### Step 2: Plan Generation with Iteration
- Opus instance creates detailed implementation plan
- Iterative refinement loop with user feedback
- Editor-based plan review and modification
- Automatic re-generation based on changes

#### Step 3: Multi-Agent Development Lifecycle
- Phase extraction from plan
- Task generation per phase (Opus)
- Individual task execution (Sonnet instances)
- Test suite creation and execution
- Phase-level review and validation

#### Step 4: Final Review
- Comprehensive implementation review
- Deliverables summary generation
- Handover documentation creation
- Success/failure assessment

### 3. Key Features Implemented
- **Timestamped Sessions**: Each refactor creates a unique session directory
- **Editor Integration**: Supports vim/nvim for interactive editing
- **Model Orchestration**: Opus for planning/review, Sonnet for implementation
- **Error Handling**: Graceful failures with descriptive messages
- **Progress Tracking**: Session metadata and status updates
- **Test Integration**: Automatic test generation and execution

### 4. Supporting Components
- **Test Suite**: Validation script for installation verification
- **Example Guide**: Template for creating refactor guides
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive README and inline documentation
- **Session Management**: Organized artifact storage and retrieval

## Architecture Decisions

1. **Bash-based Orchestration**: Leverages existing shell scripting for workflow control
2. **NPX Claude Code**: Uses SDK for programmatic instance control
3. **File-based Communication**: Uses markdown files for inter-phase communication
4. **Modular Design**: Separate scripts for each workflow phase

## Integration Points

- **APM Commands**: Seamlessly integrates with existing APM command structure
- **Claude Code CLI**: Uses standard Claude Code SDK capabilities
- **MCP Servers**: Compatible with existing MCP configuration
- **Authentication**: Works with both API key and session authentication

## File Structure Created

```

```

## Usage

```bash
# After running bootstrap.sh
/refactor path/to/refactor-guide.md
```

## Future Enhancements

While the core system is complete, potential enhancements could include:
- Session resumption capabilities
- Parallel phase execution
- Web UI for session monitoring
- Integration with version control
- Metrics and analytics
- Custom model selection per phase

## Conclusion

The refactor system successfully implements the vision outlined in the guide, creating a powerful tool for managing complex codebase changes through intelligent multi-agent orchestration.
